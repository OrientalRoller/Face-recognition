# Face-recognition
basic face regonition system using different algorithms
<h1>Face recognition git repo</h1>
<br>
not that advanced and it uses old models
<br>
I will add a project after 22 nov 2024 positively
<br>
this is my first github repo so im kinda nervous
<br>
now related to my repo I used two face detection models
namely haar cascade and neural nets
<br>
I suggest using the neural nets model since its significantly more accurate than the haar cascade one
although the haar cascade is more easier to implement
<br>
now in those files you will notice that there are two py files in each
<br>
use the real time face detection.py in haar cascade folder and real time face detection dnn in neural nets folder for the live detection
<br>
and remember to change the path in each of testing files for both neural nets and haar cascade model once you clone the repo
